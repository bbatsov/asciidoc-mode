Initial release.

=== New Features

* Tree-sitter-based syntax highlighting for headings, inline markup (bold, italic, monospace, highlight, passthrough), blocks (listing, literal, quoted), lists, admonitions, attributes, macros, metadata, links, cross-references, footnotes, and replacements
* Dual-parser architecture (`asciidoc` for block-level, `asciidoc-inline` for inline) following the same pattern as `markdown-ts-mode`
* Section navigation via `beginning-of-defun` / `end-of-defun` (`C-M-a` / `C-M-e`)
* Sentence-level movement (`M-a` / `M-e`) across paragraphs, blocks, lists, and comments
* Imenu support for section headings
* Outline minor mode enabled by default for heading folding and navigation
* Comment support (`//` line comments)
* AsciiDoc mode menu with navigation, visibility, heading manipulation, and utility commands
* `asciidoc-install-grammars` command for one-step grammar installation
* Graceful degradation to `text-mode` when grammars are unavailable
* Auto-mode entries for `.adoc` and `.asciidoc` files
